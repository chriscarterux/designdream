3. Enable **Out of Office** when needed
4. Set up **Email Signature** in Basecamp messages

### Install Mobile App

**Android:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.basecamp.bc3

## Team Management (Optional)

If you plan to hire contractors or employees:

1. Go to Account Settings → People
2. Click "Invite People"
3. Enter email addresses
4. Set permissions:
   - **Admin**: Full access (you)
   - **Member**: Can see assigned projects only
   - **Client**: Limited access (view-only for specific projects)

## Billing Setup

### Add Payment Method

1. Go to Account Settings → Billing
2. Add credit/debit card
3. Enable auto-pay to avoid disruptions
4. Download invoices monthly for accounting

### Track Expenses

Basecamp subscription = business expense:
- Monthly cost: $299 (Business plan) or $15 (Personal plan)
- Category: Software/Tools
- Tax deductible as business expense

## Security Best Practices

### Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

1. Go to My Settings → Security
2. Enable 2FA using:
   - Authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)
   - SMS backup (as fallback)
3. Save recovery codes in secure location

### Password Management

- Use unique, strong password (not reused from other services)
- Store in password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Never share your admin credentials

### Client Access

- Never give clients admin access
- Each client gets their own isolated project
- Clients can only see their project (not others)

## Integration Setup
