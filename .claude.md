## Current Development Status

### âœ… Completed
- Repository created and cloned
- Agent OS installed and configured
- Tech stack defined in `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md`
- Project documentation created (this file)

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Following Agent OS workflow to create product mission and roadmap

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Agent OS Workflow)
1. Run `/plan-product` to create mission.md, roadmap.md, tech-stack.md
2. Run `/shape-spec` or `/write-spec` for Landing Page feature
3. Run `/create-tasks` to break down implementation
4. Run `/implement-tasks` to build features

## Agent OS Workflow Reference

This project uses **Agent OS** for spec-driven development:

### Available Commands
- `/plan-product` - Create product mission, roadmap, and tech stack docs
- `/shape-spec` - Shape high-level spec for a feature
- `/write-spec` - Write detailed technical specification
- `/create-tasks` - Generate task list from spec
- `/implement-tasks` - Execute implementation tasks
- `/orchestrate-tasks` - Orchestrate complex workflows

### Directory Structure

## Development Workflow

### For New Features
1. Use Agent OS workflow: plan â†’ spec â†’ tasks â†’ implement
2. Create feature branch from main
3. Develop with daily commits
4. Test thoroughly (Vitest for unit, Playwright for e2e)
5. Create PR with description and screenshots
6. Deploy to Vercel preview environment
7. Merge to main for production deployment

### Coding Standards
All standards documented in `agent-os/standards/`:
- **Tech Stack:** `global/tech-stack.md`
- **Components:** `frontend/components.md`
- **API Design:** `backend/api.md`
- **Testing:** `testing/test-writing.md`

## Key Technologies

- **UI Library:** shadcn/ui, shadcnblocks
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth
- **Payments:** Stripe (subscriptions, customer portal)
- **Task Management:** Trello API
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Testing:** Vitest, Playwright

```

## Important Notes

- **Keep it lean:** Use Stripe's Customer Portal instead of building billing UI
- **Use Trello:** Don't build a custom kanban; leverage Trello's proven interface
- **Async communication:** No real-time chat; email updates only
- **Quality over speed:** Enterprise-grade deliverables with proper testing
- **Daily progress:** Update clients every business day with next steps and blockers
