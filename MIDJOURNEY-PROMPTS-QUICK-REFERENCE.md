## Tips for Using These Prompts

1. **Copy the entire prompt** including all parameters (--v 6, --ar, --style, --s)
2. **Iterate if needed**: Generate 4 variations, pick the best, and upscale
3. **Adjust stylize value** (--s parameter) if results are too abstract or too literal
   - Lower values (50-150) = more literal interpretation
   - Higher values (200-300) = more artistic/stylized
4. **Use --seed** parameter to create variations of a specific result you like
5. **Export multiple versions**: Regular PNG, WebP for web, 2x for retina displays
