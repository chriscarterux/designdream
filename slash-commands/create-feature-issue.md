# Rule: Generating a Feature Issue (Linear Issue Format)

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a comprehensive Feature PRD in Linear-compatible markdown format. This document serves as a complete specification for a single feature, including acceptance criteria, task breakdown, testing requirements, and validation evidence. It aligns with Linear's Issue structure.

## Process

1.  **Receive Initial Prompt:** The user describes a specific feature they want to build or references a feature from the project PRD.
2.  **Review Context:** Read the `project-prd.md` if it exists to understand how this feature fits into the larger product vision.
3.  **Analyze Codebase:** Review existing code structure, patterns, components, and conventions to ensure the feature integrates properly.
4.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Ask targeted questions about the specific feature functionality, user interactions, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.
5.  **Generate Feature Issue:** Create a comprehensive feature document using the structure outlined below.
6.  **Save Feature Issue:** Save as `/tasks/[n]-feature-[name].md` where `n` is a zero-padded 4-digit sequence (e.g., `0001-feature-user-authentication.md`).

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

Adapt questions based on the feature, but cover these areas:

*   **User Stories:** "Can you describe specific user stories for this feature? (As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit])"
*   **User Interactions:** "Walk me through the user's interaction with this feature step-by-step"
*   **Success Criteria:** "How will we know this feature is working correctly? What are the acceptance criteria?"
*   **Edge Cases:** "What edge cases or error conditions should we handle?"
*   **Data Requirements:** "What data does this feature need to display, collect, or process?"
*   **UI/UX Expectations:** "What should this look like? Are there design mockups or similar features to reference?"
*   **Performance:** "Are there any performance requirements? (e.g., load time, response time)"
*   **Integration Points:** "Does this feature integrate with other parts of the system or external services?"
*   **Testing Scope:** "What level of test coverage is expected? Unit tests? E2E tests?"

## Feature Issue Structure

### 1. Feature Header
```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]
**Issue ID:** [n]-feature-[name]
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | ðŸŸ¢ Complete
**Priority:** Critical | High | Medium | Low
**Effort:** S | M | L | XL
**Sprint/Milestone:** [Optional]
```

### 2. Overview
*   **Problem Statement:** What problem does this feature solve?
*   **User Stories:** List 2-5 user stories in "As a [user], I want to [action], so that [benefit]" format
*   **Success Impact:** How will this feature move product metrics?

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
Use Linear-compatible bullet format with checkboxes:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-1**: [Clear, testable criterion]
  - **Tests:** `file.test.ts::testName1, testName2`
  - **Evidence Required:** Screenshot of [specific state] + test output
  - **Verification:** [ ] Manual | [ ] Automated | [ ] Both

- [ ] **AC-2**: [Another criterion]
  - **Tests:** `file.test.ts::testName3`
  - **Evidence Required:** Log output showing [specific behavior]
  - **Verification:** [ ] Manual | [ ] Automated | [ ] Both

[Continue for all acceptance criteria...]
```

Each AC must be:
- **Specific:** Clearly defined success condition

*   **Filename:** `[n]-feature-[name].md`
*   **Evidence Directory:** `/tasks/evidence/[n]-feature-[name]/`

## Workflow Integration

After creating the feature issue:

1. **Copy to Linear:** The markdown format is designed to copy-paste directly into Linear
2. **Create Sub-Issues:** Each task can become a Linear sub-issue
3. **Track Progress:** Update checkboxes as work progresses
4. **Collect Evidence:** Save screenshots, logs, and test outputs to evidence directory
5. **Final Validation:** Mark feature complete only when all criteria met

## Final Instructions

1. Read `project-prd.md` for context before generating
2. Analyze existing codebase patterns and structure
3. Ask clarifying questions to ensure comprehensive AC coverage
4. Generate complete feature issue with all sections
5. Create evidence directory structure: `/tasks/evidence/[n]-feature-[name]/`
6. After completion, remind user: "Use `/process-tasks` to implement this feature step-by-step with validation gates."
